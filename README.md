3DInterface_01    
==============

Prototype for a 3D widget in ActionScript 3.0 within the project "Interfaces To Handle Data Complexity".
The prototype is self-contained meaning it comprises a tiny 3D engine + tiny 3D Physics Engine, all tied
together in an MVC fashion.

The main class is V2View.as that can be referenced straight from Flash.
