3DInterface_01    
==============

Prototype for a 3D widget in ActionScript 3.0 within the project "Interfaces To Handle Data Complexity".
The prototype is self-contained meaning that it comprises a tiny 3D engine + tiny 3D Physics Engine, all
tied together in an MVC fashion. All in order to keep the .swf file small (about 30Kb).

The main class is V2View.as that can be referenced straight from Flash.
